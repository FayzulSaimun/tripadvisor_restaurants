Overall Arzak challenges it\u2019s guests with exciting and at least for me often surprising flavors that coexist in a balanced tension in each of the fascinating dishes. The culinary journey was enhanced by the knowledgeable and attentive staff and Elena Azark\u2019s own charming presence.

For example, we had a table for six in an alcove at the end of a long narrow dining room. We did have a bit more privacy but we had servers bumping up against us for three hours because of a lack of space. We would have been better off had we exchanged locations with a table for two close to us. Because we are not visible from the main dining room we tend not to get replenished with different items. Ladies have to put their purses on the floor, not such a big deal, but not what we usually see in a 3-star Michelin. It startled us a bit when the staff pulled out a ballpoint pen to point at all the different dessert items on this dessert tree of goodies. The food is decent, but the service and the setting fell short. Compare to the other two 3-star restaurants, the price is similar, but the value is less.", "rating": "3", "reviewed_at": "21 October 2021"},
